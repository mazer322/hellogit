Gather river of light that guides fairies 
Shine to destroy the fang of evil 
Fairy Glitter


I am a dragon
Who roar
In order to awake the wind
And become voice of Dragon 
Dragon Wind Roar 
Song of the Wind

I am steel
Steel knows no fear, Steel knows no doubt.
When faced with my enemy, I hesitate not.
I am a weapon to destroy these.
Iron-Blood Transformation!
